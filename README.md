# microPFD
The microPFD software is a tiny but functional Primary Flight Display (PFD) for iOS, which was developed to demonstrate the capabilities of consumer hardware in aviation. As open-source software it is available for free, however requires Pythonista 3 to be installed. While microPFD may also become a life saver in scenarios where aircraft avionics equipment fails, it is not intended to be used as a primary navigation equipment for aviation.

Usage:
1. Tap the digital heading display to switch to GPS track.
2. Tap the digital waypoint information display to make a direct-to leg by entering a 4 letter ICAO airport code.
3. Tap the cross in the top-right corner to exit microPFD and return to the Pythonista console.

## Installation
To install the software, download the iOS Pythonita 3 App to your iOS device (iPhone or iPad). Import the files on this GitHub repository and run the Main.py script.
